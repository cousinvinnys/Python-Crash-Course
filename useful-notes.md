# Notes

## Chapter 2

- `print(f"String {variable}")`
- \n is newline, \t is tab
- `lstrip()` = left side of a string, `rstrip()` right side, and `strip()` both sides
- Exponents: `3 ** 2` = 9

## Chapter 3: Lists

- Index -1 means last element in the list. -2 is second to last, etc etc.
- Can modify items in a list `motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'`
- Append, add to end of list. `motorcycles.append('ducati')`
- Can insert and delete items at an index
- Can pop at an index: `mc = motorcycles.pop(1)`
- Can remove at a value: `motorcycles.remove('honda')`
- Sort reverse: `cars.sorted(reverse=True)`
- `sorted()`: temporary sort method


## Chapter 4: Working with Lists

  - Subset of a list: `print(plyers[1:3])` prints the players from the first to the third index (by zero ofc)
  - Copying a list: `friend_foods = my_foods[:]`
  - **Immutable list**: Tuple
  - Example tuple: set with parentheses, used for data that does not change. `dimensions = (100, 90)`
